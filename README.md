    This is an old snippet tool that I've been using since about 2014.<br />
It has absolute basic functionality, terrible structure, terrible codebase and is probably broken,<br />
outdated, deprecated or otherwise wrong in every way.  </p>

## Why?

Most tools today are written with various Frameworks, with various pre-/postprocessors and get optimized, concatenated, compressed and bundled.
This tool was written without all that fancy stuff.
Besides jQuery, Prettify and smaller plugins, it was and still is quite simple. At least compared to todays apps.
The whole tool had a strange and outdated structure that I hope to never really understand.
But over the years, this old tool has served me well and did it's job.

## What?

The Web was quite different in 2014 and the way this tool was build, was probably kind of reasonable.
Reasonable developer would probably start from scratch or move to a newer and probably better tool, I chose to refactor the whole thing and try to replace everything with a solid foundation.
But it's about time, to bring this trusty tool into the modern web.
