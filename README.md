# RawSnippets
An attempt in keeping a very old Snippetsystem alive. NOT STABLE

## WHAT?

This is an old snippet tool that I've been using since about 2014.
It has absolute basic functionality, terrible structure, terrible layout and is probably broken, outdated, deprecated or otherwise wrong in every way.

## WHY?
Over the years, this old snippet tool has served me well, and I've used it often.
But it always felt a bit strange, and when I took a closer look at the code, I soon found the reason why.

The whole tool had a strange and outdated structure that I hope to never really understand.
For example, I will never understand the resoning that led to using `<label>` elements for everything that is somehow related to text. For literally everthing.

Anyway... I got used to the tool and thought it would be a nice exercise to keep it usable and maybe make it a little more usable for myself.

## FOUND SOMETHING?

Since this is full of bugs, broken stuff and other worst-practices, it's not hard to fiund things to improve, rewrite or otherwise do it in a better way. Feel free to open an Issue or leave a PR if you want. With a foundation like this, it's not easy to keep track of all the TODOs.

## DISCLAIMER
This should not be used by anybody and is definatly full of bugs and other *surprise features*.
If you try to use it, I'm not reliable for anything happening with you, your server or your data.
DON'T USE IT OR AT LEAST USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!
